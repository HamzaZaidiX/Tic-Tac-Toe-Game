# Tic-Tac-Toe-Multiplayer-Game
**Tic Tac Toe Game** Made by **Html, CSS &amp; Mainly Javascript**

My `Tic Tac Toe Game` is Amazing and a `Multiplayer Game` because it has good Background Music and when you want character `X` or `0` the table make a `ring sound` and when you win the game `Celebrates your wining with a gif and confetti` also you can `Reset to play another Game with your Friend` also it will `tell your Scores`.
