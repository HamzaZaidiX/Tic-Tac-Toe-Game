# Tic-Tac-Toe-Multiplayer-Game

My `Tic Tac Toe Game` built with `Html, CSS &amp; Mainly Javascript` is Amazing `Multiplayer Game` and has a good `Background Music` and when you want character `X` or `0` the score board will tells `who's turn is now` and When you click the the Table make a `Click Tone Sound` and when you Wins 🏆 the game `Celebrates your wining with a gif and confetti`🎊 also you can `Reset to play another Game with your Friend` also it will `tell your Scores`.
